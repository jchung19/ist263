<h2>Minds of SU Affirmations and Books & Podcast Recommendations Posts | Hill Communications Real Chemistry account</h2>
<p>Below are two posts for Minds of SU, a student wellness campaign created by students on the Real Chemistry account that I spearheaded in creating and was designed by members of the TNH Ad Agency. The first post was an affirmations post, for which I was inspired to create because affirmations are a popular topic in mental health discourse. The second post was a books and podcast recommendations post, where I had all the members of our team list either a podcast or a book that they have been enjoying and that students can turn to when they need a self-care day.Below are two posts for Minds of SU, a student wellness campaign created by students on the Real Chemistry account that I spearheaded in creating and was designed by members of the TNH Ad Agency.
