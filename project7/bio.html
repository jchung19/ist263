    <p>My name is Jade Chung and I am currently a senior at Syracuse University. My name is Jade Chung, and I am a senior public relations major at the Newhouse School of Public Communications at Syracuse University and I am also minoring in Information Management and Technology at the School of Information Studies. I am also currently serving as the editor-in-chief at Globalists, a Syracuse University publication with diversity and inclusion at its core. Although I currently aspire to be a public relations practitioner, I love to discuss all things media and am also a staff writer at The Daily Orange.

        Born in Seoul, South Korea and raised in Hong Kong, I grew up experiencing the beauty of diversity firsthand attending international schools. Since then, I strive to promote diversity through my work in public relations. I am most interested in working in the fashion & beauty, sports, and entertainment sectors of PR.
