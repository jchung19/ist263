        Hello! My name is Jade Chung. I am a rising senior at Syracuse University, majoring in public relations at the Newhouse School of Public Communications and minoring in information management and technology at the School of Information Studies. Being born in Seoul, South Korea, raised in Hong Kong, and having attended international schools, I understand the necessity for diversity in the media, a valuable asset to my public relations work. I am also proficient in four languages, a skill that has allowed me to better understand the nuances of cultures different from my own.

        I am interested in public relations because it combines all of the activities I enjoy doing––writing, event planning, graphic design, and intercultural interaction. My public relations degree ties together well with my minor in IT, as public communication strategies are increasingly becoming more rooted in the digital space.
